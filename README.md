# Restaurant Customer Insights and Loyalty Program Analysis


In this project, I delve into analyzing a restaurant's sales, menu, and customer membership data to uncover valuable insights into customer behavior and the effectiveness of the restaurant's loyalty programs. The dataset covers customer orders, menu items, and their sign-up dates for the restaurant's membership program. By answering key questions about customer spending, preferences, and loyalty points, this project aims to help the restaurant understand its customers better and optimize its offerings.

Key questions addressed include:

Customer Spending: How much has each customer spent at the restaurant, and which menu items are the most popular?

Visit Frequency: How often do customers return to the restaurant, and what is their purchasing behavior over time?

First Purchases: What was the first menu item each customer purchased, and how does this affect their future buying habits?

Menu Popularity: Whatâ€™s the most frequently purchased item on the menu across all customers?

Loyalty Points: How many loyalty points do customers earn based on their spending, considering special point multipliers for certain items or promotional periods?
Using SQL queries, I extracted these insights to not only help the restaurant improve customer engagement but also enhance its loyalty program and marketing strategies. The findings are valuable for personalizing customer experiences and making data-driven decisions on product offerings and loyalty rewards.
